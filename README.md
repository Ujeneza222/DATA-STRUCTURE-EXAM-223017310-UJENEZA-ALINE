This is a basic C++ program that utilizes structures and polymorphism to achieve an attendance system. There is a Date struct to store dates and an AttendanceRecord struct that has a student ID, a pointer to a date, and a presence boolean. Two report classes, DailyAttendanceReport and TrendAttendanceReport, inherit from an abstract ReportInterface to generate attendance reports. The program accommodates dynamic attendance record management, including adding and removing records and resizing the underlying array. It accommodates dynamic memory management for date objects that have been allocated. Sample attendance records are constructed, reports are displayed, and a record is removed in the main function to demonstrate how the system operates before releasing allocated memory.
